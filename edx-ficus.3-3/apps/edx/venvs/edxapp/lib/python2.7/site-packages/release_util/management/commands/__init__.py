class MigrationSession(object):
    """
    Class which performs migrations while keeping track of the state of each migration.
    Provides the state of all migrations post-migration.

    If you want to run specific migrations, you can either initialize it with
    a list of migration tuples, or add migrations by calling add_migrations(),
    then call apply().

    If you want to run all migrations, simply call apply_all(). Calling
    apply_all() while a MigrationSession has migrations added to it will raise
    an error.

    Once either apply() or apply_all() has been called, calling apply(),
    apply_all(), or add_migrations() will raise a MigrationSessionError.

    MigrationSession.state is a list of "step" dicts of the following form:
    [
        {
            'migration': 'all' | (app: str, migration_name: str),
            'duration': float,
            'output': str,
            'success': [(app: str, migration_name: str), ...],
            'failure': (app: str, migration_name: str) | None,
            'traceback': str | None,
            'succeeded': bool,
        },
        ...
    ]

    migration: The tuple of the requested migration that triggered the step
    duration:  The amount of time in seconds it took to run the step
    output:    The stdout of the manage.py migrate command that applied the migrations
    succeeded_migrations:
               A list of migration tuples that succeeded
    failed_migration:
               The migration that failed if any
    traceback: The traceback with which the migration failed if any
    succeeded: Whether the step succeeded. Note a migration step can fail
               even when all the individual migrations succeed (thus
               traceback != None and failure == None)

    Even when applied with specific migrations, there's no guarantee that no
    other migrations will run because each migration might have dependencies.
    Thus, MigrationSession.state is a list of "steps", where each step is a
    single migration state that was requested.

    For example, if you run MigrationSession(None, database_name, (myapp, 0003)).apply()
    and myapp.0003 depends on myapp.0002, the state will consist of a single
    step with "migration" == ("myapp", "0003") and (hopefully)
    "success" = [("myapp", "0002"), ("myapp", "0003")].
