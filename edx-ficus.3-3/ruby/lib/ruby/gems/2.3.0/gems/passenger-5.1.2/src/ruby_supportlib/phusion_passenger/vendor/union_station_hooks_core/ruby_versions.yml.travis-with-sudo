# This configuration file tells the test suite which Ruby interpreters to
# test against. Below is an example utilizing RVM.
#
# N.B. this is the environment used as part of the Passenger module tests
# (as opposed to the environment used for the Submodule tests)
#
# If you want test coverage reporting via simplecov to work, then this list
# must contain the main Ruby interpreter that you are using, and the entry
# for that Ruby interpreter must execute Ruby through 'bundle exec'. In the
# example below, this is the case for Ruby 1.9.3.

# these are still supported so we pin to the travis version and re-pin whenever they do
- name: Ruby 1.9.3-p551
  command: rvm-exec ruby-1.9.3-p551 bundle exec ruby
- name: Ruby 2.1.10
  command: rvm-exec ruby-2.1.10 ruby
- name: Ruby 2.2.5
  command: rvm-exec ruby-2.2.5 ruby
